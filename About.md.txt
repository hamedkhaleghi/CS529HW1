This visualization employs circles to symbolize instances of death across various cities in the United States. Notably, major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston are distinguished by unique colors, enhancing the clarity of the representation. In the histogram, the data is categorized into male and female fatalities, each presented separately. A noteworthy feature is that when the mouse hovers over a bar within the histogram, the corresponding state on the US map is highlighted in bold, facilitating a more intuitive understanding of the data's geographic distribution.

Furthermore, the states on the map are color-coded, transitioning from white to dark red. This color spectrum serves as a visual indicator of the death rates, where lighter shades signify lower mortality rates and darker shades represent higher mortality rates within each state. This multi-faceted visualization approach provides a comprehensive and informative depiction of mortality data across the United States.
